# Fruit Ninja Game

## Project Overview
This project is a Python-based Fruit Ninja game built using Pygame. It simulates the classic Fruit Ninja game mechanics, allowing players to slice various fruits that appear on the screen while avoiding bombs. The game includes intuitive gameplay, animations, and sounds.

## Features
- **Player Interaction:** Slice fruits by moving the mouse or tapping on the screen (depending on the platform).
- **Multiple Levels:** Increasing difficulty as players progress through levels.
- **Bombs:** Bombs appear alongside fruits, and hitting one results in a game over.
- **Score Tracking:** Players can track their score and see high scores on the screen.
- **Animations and Sounds:** Realistic animations for fruit slicing, as well as sound effects for slicing fruits and hitting bombs.
- **Timed Mode:** A countdown timer adds to the challenge.

## Technologies Used
- **Pygame:** For handling game graphics, sound, and animations.
- **Python:** The main programming language for implementing game logic and mechanics.

## Installation Instructions
